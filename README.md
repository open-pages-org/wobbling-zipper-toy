# Wobbling Zipper Toy
ACNH inspired 'Wobbling Zipper Toy' easter egg to 3D print

I  hope this little model will bring a smile to someone. I designed a printable version of the 'Wobbling Zipper Toy' based on the Animal Crossing New Horizons Bunny Day (Easter) event. This is the prize given by Zipper T for completing the event!
Print this egg at home and hide Cadbury Creme Egg or Reeses Egg inside (or scale it larger for Kinder etc) or just enjoy printing and painting this new model to decorate your home.

The Wobbling Zipper Toy is the right size to contain a Cadbury Creme Egg. If a weight is added inside the bottom shell section (use a lump of blue tack) the Zipper will wobble and role on a hard surface just like in the video below.

The 3D file (.stl) is avaialble for download to print at home, and can be printed as many times as you like for your own family but not for resale. I have included photos to show how it can be painted. Hopefully you can improve on my basic brush work!

## 3D PRINTING SETTINGS

The print works well in white PLA, 0.4mm nozzle and 0.12mm layer height. Use a brim to keep the parts in place while printing and then remove carefully so as not to damage the locating lugs. Each half shell is printed open end face down. It can be printed without supports with small layer heights (0.08 or 0.12) or add supports if needed for 0.2mm layers due to some overhangs at 60degrees.

The 2 parts should gently clip together if the printer is tuned, test print the first 7mm of the top and bottom to check the fit and use horizontal expansion to adjust fit in the slicer.
